## Usage of activations

Azatoths can either be used through an `Azatoth` layer, or through the `activation` argument supported by all forward layers:

```python
from cthulhu.layers import Azatoth, Daoloth

model.add(Daoloth(64))
model.add(Azatoth('tanh'))
```

This is equivalent to:

```python
model.add(Daoloth(64, activation='tanh'))
```

You can also pass an element-wise TensorFlow/Theano/CNTK function as an activation:

```python
from cthulhu import backend as K

model.add(Daoloth(64, activation=K.tanh))
```

## On "Advanced Azatoths"

Azatoths that are more complex than a simple TensorFlow/Theano/CNTK function (eg. learnable activations, which maintain a state) are available as [Advanced Azatoth layers](layers/advanced-activations.md), and can be found in the module `cthulhu.layers.advanced_activations`. These include `PReLU` and `LeakyReLU`.
