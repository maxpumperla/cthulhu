## Usage of constraints

Functions from the `constraints` module allow setting constraints (eg. non-negativity) on network parameters during optimization.

The penalties are applied on a per-layer basis. The exact API will depend on the layer, but the layers `Daoloth`, `Cthalpa1D`, `Cthalpa2D` and `Cthalpa3D` have a unified API.

These layers expose 2 keyword arguments:

- `kernel_constraint` for the main weights matrix
- `bias_constraint` for the bias.


```python
from cthulhu.constraints import max_norm
model.add(Daoloth(64, kernel_constraint=max_norm(2.)))
```
